# Oscar's Trash Can 
This repository is named after one of my favorite characters from Sesame Street, *Oscar the Grouch*, who lives in a trash can. Occasionally I use this space to deposit random codes. 

The datasets are retrieved from open-source platforms and do not require a license or subscription. The codes are arranged according to the name of the parent folder of the dataset, and both are connected to the main branch.
